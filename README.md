Project Description:

In this project, the goal is to be one report which could be used by management team to make decisions. The focus is made on the following

1. User-empathetic Dashboard/ Report design
2. Drillable Insights

I learned the following things in this project - 

a. **Domain Knowledge**

1. Hospitality domain key metrics -
2. Total Available Rooms - Total number of rooms – Number of rooms out of order/not in service/out of inventory
3. RevPar(Revenue per Available Room ) - Total Room Revenue / Total Rooms Available
4. Average Daily Rate(ADR) - Rooms Revenue / Paid Rooms Occupied
5. Occupancy % - Paid Rooms Occupied / Rooms Available
6. RevPar = Occupancy % * ADR therefore we can say RevPar <= ADR
7. SRN (Sellable room Nights) – Days * Total Available Rooms
8. DSRN (Daily Sellable room Nights ) - Total Available Rooms
9. URN (Utilized Room Nights) – customer stayed or Customer who checked out
10. BRN – Total Bookings(customer stayed + No show + Cancelled)
11. Realization – URN / BRN

b.** PowerBI**

1.Power Query (Basic and Advanced Operations)
2.Basic and complex DAX formulas 
3.Data modelling 
4.Choosing the right visuals and formatting 
5.Dashboard designing principles
6.Deploying in Power BI service
